            <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
            <p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that enables the exchange of information and communication worldwide. It has revolutionized how we connect, share, and access knowledge.</p>
            
            <h2>What is the World Wide Web?</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web, often referred to as the Web, is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. It introduced a user-friendly way to navigate and interact with information online.</p>

                    <p>In 1962, J.C.R. Licklider at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) first elucidated his dream of a "Galactic Network" connecting computers across the globe for the distribution and access of data and programs.</p>
                    <p>Licklider went on to become the first director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an arm of the U.S. Department of Defense and the body that funded and coordinated the original research into what became the Internet.</p>
                    <p>Kleinrock proposed using packet switching instead of circuits for communication, while Roberts developed the first wide-area computing network (ARPANET) using telephone lines.</p>
